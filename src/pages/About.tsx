    `A Chennai-based artist whose practice is driven by a lifelong devotion to art and creative inquiry, Roshna Sanjay creates a body of work that centers on energyâ€”its movement, resonance, and quiet afterglow. Her paintings have been presented in exhibitions across Chennai, where viewers and curators alike note the way her surfaces seem to transmit a palpable charge rather than merely depict it. Each composition is conceived as a conduit, inviting the audience to feel as much as to see.`,
    `She has studied with the eminent A. V. Ilango, a mentorship that informs her rigorous craft and clarity of intent. Committed to continual growth, Roshna expands her artistic skills through daily study and studio experimentation, with plans underway to open a dedicated studio space that will deepen both her practice and her dialogue with the community.`,
